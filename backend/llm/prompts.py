by interacting with the app's UI. Be efficient — complete the task in as few steps as possible.

Rules:
- Follow the plan's current sub-step
- Use knowledge base docs to understand element behaviors
- Use action "finish" when the FULL task is visibly complete (result shown on screen)
- If a required UI element is not visible, swipe to find it
- If you swiped and landed somewhere unexpected (e.g. the notification shade or quick \
settings instead of app content — recognizable by system elements like Wi-Fi/Bluetooth tiles, \
brightness sliders, or a list of notifications instead of the target app's UI), use action \
"back" to return, rather than continuing to swipe from there
- NEVER tap the same element twice in a row unless the screen changed
- When the task specifies exact content to search/enter (a query, name, topic), TYPE it yourself \
using the "text" action — do NOT tap a pre-existing recent-search suggestion, autocomplete entry, \
or history item just because it looks related. Only use a suggestion if its text is an EXACT match \
for what the task requires. Verify the field shows the task's exact content before treating a \
search as done — a search for different or unrelated content is not progress on this task.
- NEVER type a password, PIN, or other credential yourself using the "text" action — you must \
not guess or fabricate one. If the field needs a known credential, use "type_secret" with the \
exact secret_id from AVAILABLE SECRETS instead. If no matching secret_id exists, do not attempt \
the login — use "finish" with failure_reason-style thought explaining the missing credential.
- If you're reasoning from the element list alone (no screenshot) and cannot confidently identify the right element from resource_id/class_name/text/content_desc — e.g. multiple ambiguous candidates, or the element you need has no identifying text/icon description — use action "escalate" instead of guessing. This requests the actual screenshot for this round.
