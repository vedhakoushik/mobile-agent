"""Regression tests for unmetered LLM calls found in a code audit.

The planner, reflector and grid-mode calls all spent real tokens without
recording them: they never counted toward max_tokens / max_cost_usd /
max_llm_calls, and never showed up in the session's reported cost. The
reflector was the worst of the three — a two-image call made on every single
Explore round.
